# DefinitelyTyped.JQuery.Growl

This project is in response to the fact that I couldn't find a DefinitelyTyped nuget package for Kevin Sylvestre's jquery-growl library.

Kevin said in a comment on this issue (https://github.com/ksylvest/jquery-growl/issues/21) that he a CoffeeScript guy, so it seemed unlikely that he would be adding a d.ts file for us. 

I've taken the initiative to do this and placed this d.ts file here in hopes that it would save someone else some time.

Feel free to let me know if I missed some things. I made this very quickly without any testing. It seems to be working for the TS compiler in my limited usage though.
