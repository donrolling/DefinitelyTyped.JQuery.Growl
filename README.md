# DefinitelyTyped.JQuery.Growl

This project is in response to the fact that I couldn't find a DefinitelyTyped nuget package for Kevin Sylvestre's jquery-growl library.

Kevin said in a comment on this issue (https://github.com/ksylvest/jquery-growl/issues/21) that he a CoffeeScript guy, so it seemed unlikely that he would be adding a d.ts file for us. 

I've taken the initiative and place this d.ts file here for free use.
